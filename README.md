# L.I.F.E-Theory
**Theory L.I.F.E: Learning Individually From Experience** **Introduction** In a world characterized by rapid changes and constant demands, the quest for personal fulfillment often leads individuals to pursue external markers of success— wealth, career achievements, and social validation. However, these pursuits frequently leave a sense of emptiness where genuine fulfillment should reside. The Theory L.I.F.E (Learning Individually From Experience) posits that true self-actualization, the ultimate goal of personal development, stems from a deep investment in oneself through experiential learning. This theory aligns with Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, emphasizing that self-actualization is an individualized journey fueled by unique experiences and reflective practices.
